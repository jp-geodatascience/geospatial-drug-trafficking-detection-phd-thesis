# Detection of Geospatial Objects Linked to Drug Trafficking
*An approach based on Geospatial Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence*  
*Companion repository for the doctoral thesis (UFPR)*

This repository accompanies the doctoral thesis **“Detection of geospatial objects linked to drug trafficking: an approach based on geospatial intelligence and artificial intelligence.”** It provides a concise overview, citation details, and pointers for readers and practitioners working at the intersection of GEOINT, remote sensing, and AI for the analysis of organised crime and illicit economies.

## Summary
The thesis proposes a methodology—grounded in the intelligence cycle—for **detecting geospatial objects linked to Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs)** using **multispectral satellite imagery**, **ground-truth data**, and **open-source information**. It integrates **Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT)** with **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, training deep-learning models for **image classification** and **object detection**.

Two satellite-imagery datasets are created to support AI applications: **CocaPaste-PI-DETECTION** and **AmazonCRIME**. Models achieve **evaluation metrics above 90%**, with analyses of generalisation and multiple experiments. The work also builds an **NLP-based environmental scanning dataset** to identify trends and potential **cocaine trafficking routes**, and outlines a conceptual foundation covering DTO dynamics, cocaine hydrochloride production processes, GEOINT from a law-enforcement perspective, and AI applied to remote sensing. These contributions enable an up-to-date intelligence picture and can strengthen decision-making for intervention and prevention strategies. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
